# Sourdough-Calculator

## Motivation

This (as you might imagine) is a tiny little side project that grew out of a need to get the ingredient quantities of a sourdough loaf bake right!

## Features

A highlight is that all calculations and equations are explicit and implemented in a corresponding user-friendly calculator (using the amazing open source app framework [`streamlit`](https://streamlit.io)).

## Details

I won't be describing the project in detail here, it is fairly self-explanatory, you may navigate directly to the live version of the calculator [`here`](https://sourdough-calculator.streamlit.app/) and start using it immediately.
